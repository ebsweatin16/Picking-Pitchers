1.	Name: Eric Breton

2.	“Picking Pitchers Coors Field”
o	Examine how the style of pitcher impacts his success at Coors Field
3.	High level description of the project: what question or problem are you addressing?
o	Identify the most pitching variable for runs scored against
o	Identify the least important variables
o	Determine if all things equal is there a type of pitcher that is destined for success/failure
4.	Full on Data Science Project 
o	classification using supervised learning
o	clustering to profile pitchers
o	data visualization
o	data cleansing techniques
o	web scraping techniques
5.	The data will encompass 25 years of home games which accounts to roughly 2025 instances of collections with roughly 10 pitching metrics
6.	I will analyze the data by first using unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering to group similar pitchers based on style, additionally I hope to build in machine learning aspects which can help determine whether or not a pitcher’s “style” suits them for Coors Field.
7.	Inevitably there will be many outliers in the data, so I will have to do rigorous testing to leave out less meaningful data points which may skew my results. Additionally, I will need to do a lot of analyzing of what pitching stats are most impactful on performance.
